# C# OOP Polymorphism example

### Polymorphism Explained:

* `Polymorphism` in object-oriented programming means "many forms." 
It allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. 
This enables the same interface to perform different actions based on the object type.

* `Polymorphism` comes in two forms in C#:
    * `Compile-Time Polymorphism` (Static Binding, Method Overloading)
    * `Run-Time Polymorphism` (Dynamic Binding, Method Overriding)
